           <p> <b> <font color="black" size="3"> My early life was spent in an environment that was rich with color and design. The Hispanic and Native American influences in the small village I lived in as a child surrounded me, helping to create the warp on which my life has been woven. 
I grew up in New Mexico by the banks of the Rio Grande in the shadow of the majestic Sandia Mountains. New Mexican life is not only rich with tradition but also with color and natural phenomena.
I was lucky to have a family that valued the natural beauty of the land.

  <font color="black" size="3">  <b>
Many days my grandfather and I roamed the mountains around his house, exploring caves and rocky outcrops, collecting fossils, and learning about the plants and animals. At night we would all lie about on the warm granite boulders telling stories, while watching the sunset over the ancient volcanos to the West. I gardened with my Mother and irrigated the rich soil of the Rio Grande valley with my Father. This was the environment that served as my earliest inspiration, and the connection to the earth it instilled inspires me today. </b>
